        <h2>Today I am a twenty-one-year-old girl. In these twenty-one years, I have faced many ups and downs with my father, mother, and family members. I heard the story of my childhood from my mother's mouth, and just like five children, I also found solace in my mother's arms in the year 2002. My condition was somewhat unknown and my mother felt as if I couldn't make any sound like the other five children. Then began the series of visits to ENT doctors. At the age of eighteen months, they took me to Belur. The doctors there informed us about my congenital issues. It felt like the sky had fallen on everyone's head in the family. The battle of my parents started about how to raise me normally just like the other five children.

            I was admitted to a regular school. My studies went on with all the other normal children. At home, I started taking classes with a special teacher. It was during this time that my father came across an organization called "Anwesha Kolkata," which is an organization for special children and their parents. They guided us just like the parents of hearing-impaired children, how they raised them. Once a week, I used to go there for speech therapy and language therapy. With the help of "Anwesha Kolkata" and the special teacher at home, I passed my first significant exam and completed my secondary education today. The long journey was not easy for me and my parents. But today, I feel that I am not different from others; I can do whatever they can do.</h2>

<h2>Anwesha Kolkata is a well known organization in the field of disability in West Bengal. It is an organization of parents and well wishers of children and persons with hearing impairment. We had our first meeting in November 2004. We met as few parents looking for answers to our children’s inherent issues in different spheres of life – hearing, speech, language, education, socialization and inclusion. We felt that we could share our worries and aspirations and learn from one another. We slowly discovered that together we can be stronger and can help other children and their families with our collective knowledge, skill, experience, and understanding. Over the years we also realized that we would have to fight for our children’s rights and we can best do that in a group.

    We believe that our children must grow up in an inclusive barrier-free environment with other children, should enjoy equal rights as anyone else. We put every effort to ensure that they are not denied their rights and learn to fulfill their responsibilities. We want all deaf children to grow into responsible and valuable citizens of our country.
    
    Our work has been recognized by the state government. We received the state award for best parents’ association in 2011 and 2017.  Besides, we are also recipients of the Mahasweta Devi Memorial Award 2017 for advocating the rights of deaf children and young adults. We have touched the lives of hundreds of families with children and persons with deafness through our activities over a decade and received “The Telegraph Education Foundation” Certification of Honour For “Touching Lives”!.</h2>

    <h2>Self advocacy is the best form of advocacy where people are empowered to talk for themselves and ask for their rights. The self advocacy group of young adults BONDHU was formed few years ago.

        BONDHU is a group of vibrant youths who believe that they have right to enjoy a barrier free life and should be able to enjoy human rights on an equal basis with others. They dream for a society free of discriminations, for people with deafness and for everyone.
        
        They are learning that they have the same personal, civil and political rights as everyone else. They are also learning that responsibilities come with rights and self advocacy is a way of life.
